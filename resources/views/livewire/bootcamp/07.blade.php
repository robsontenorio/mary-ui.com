    <p>
        We could expand this Bootcamp forever by adding more and more cool features, but we are done for now.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at docs and see by yourself on how much you can do with less code.
        Every component has been carefully handcrafted to provide an extreme DX/UX/UI.

        Also check the <a href="/docs/demos">maryUI demos</a> and get amazed by how much great stuff you can do.
        Each demo contains <strong>real world code</strong> and straight approaches to get the most out of maryUI and Livewire.
